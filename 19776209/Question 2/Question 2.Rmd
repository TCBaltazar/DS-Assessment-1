# Introduction

The dataset used for this particular exercise merges data on billionaires in `r length(unique(df2$country))` countries. It contains 2755 observations in 7 variables, including the names of millionaires, their networth, the source of their wealth, their rank on the millionaires list, their age, and the industry within which they made their fortune. This discussion will present some diagrams in order to better understand the characteristics of billionaires.
